I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don\'t feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don\'t know why anyone even likes me.

Every ounce of joy feels fleeting. All the while, beyond my realm of darkness, I am surrounded by the buzzing of what life is like for others. I wish I could see what they see. Feel what they feel.

I\'m new to this sub, but not to BDD. I notice a lot of users on here think they\'re so ugly that nothing could make them look worse--so they pursue plastic surgery in hopes of getting an improvement that will magically release them from their mental illness.\n\nWell, I\'m here to tell you that yes, you can look worse than you do now after plastic surgery. In fact, you\'re more at risk of getting botched if you go into surgery with untreated BDD.\n\nI\'ll share my story as a warning. I want to help people on here avoid what I went through.\n\nThis is a long post, but I assure you it\'s worth reading if you are planning to have cosmetic work done and live with untreated BDD.\n\nFirst, a short background: Prior to getting cosmetic surgery, I was objectively a moderately attractive person. I had early symptoms of BDD, but it wasn\'t until age 11 that my BDD actually became destructive. I focused almost exclusively on my skin, and my BDD was a constant source of anxiety and despair. I lived with severe BDD until age 18, when enough changes were happening in my life that my mental illness entered a more benign state. Between 18-26 my symptoms were mild and I could focus on other things. Around 27 my BDD ramped up again and I became fixated on changing everything about my face--but my nose was my greatest obsession.\n\nI pursued a lot of unnecessary plastic surgery in a short period of time and wound up getting botched. I was irrational at the time I booked the surgeries and chose to ignore obvious red flags. Let me repeat: Because I felt so impossibly ugly, and was thinking so irrationally, I disregarded red flags. I also disregarded the advice of good surgeons who told me I looked fine and did not need surgery.\n\nWhen you pursue cosmetic surgery with untreated BDD, you are more at risk of:\n\nNot asking enough questions or the right questions during consults\n\nProceeding with a surgeon who offers you the moon/unrealistic outcomes\n\nIgnoring surgeons who advise you to avoid surgery\n\nIgnoring the concerns of friends and family\n\nChoosing a surgeon in another country without considering how this impacts aftercare\n\nSpending impulsively on treatments and consultations\n\nDisregarding negative reviews because you think a bad result won\'t happen to you\n\nChoosing a surgeon based on bedside manner rather than reviews and results\n\nRationalizing that even if you don\'t get a great result, any improvement is better than what you\'re currently living with\n\nOvervaluing positive reviews, especially reviews that don\'t include photos\n\nIgnoring your gut when something feels off\n\nEveryone who pursues cosmetic surgery faces these risks, but for people with BDD these risks are amplified because you are delusional, desperate, and often times in a state of high-functioning psychosis.\n\nSurgery will not fix your disorder. No matter the outcome, you will keep getting more and more surgeries because you will never be satisfied, not even by a good result. And the more surgeries you have, the more you risk emerging from surgery unnatural, unrecognizable, and botched.\n\nThis is what happened to me. I had a good primary rhinoplasty result but still wasn\'t satisfied, so I pursed a revision with a different surgeon who removed all the cartilage from my tip and left me scarred and blobby. The revision surgery of that revision left me without an infratip and a recessed, retracted columella. I look operated on, and now I have a shapeless triangle in the middle of my face. Worse, this third surgery has changed my favorite feature--my smile.\n\nIt took botching my nose, losing my identity, and spending a bucketload of money to do it for me to finally face my BDD and pursue treatment for my mental illness.\n\nLet my story be a warning and a call to action. Do not pursue plastic surgery before you pursue therapy and/or self-help for your BDD. Get help first. BDD causes delusional thinking and it is likely you are operating in an irrational, delusional state when you pursue surgery. You may think your thoughts are rational because in your head your ugliness is plain as day. But BDD is a mental illness that can alter the way your brain sees itself in reflections. The way I perceived myself before getting surgery changed hour to hour, day to day.\n\nYou are not objective, you are not rational. You have a mental illness and that part of you needs treatment, not your body.\n\nAnd remember, you can always look worse than you do now. I wouldn\'t say I look like a monster after my surgeries (that would be my BDD talking), but I don\'t look quite right anymore, and I am certainly less attractive.\n\nI am now searching for worth and meaning in areas outside of my appearance. I hope to share a positive update here soon. For now, please consider my warning and take care.',7,0,0,-0.3,26.7,'2021-09-25 13:35:47'),(13,'Update to You Can Always Look Worse -- Turns out life doesn\'t wait for BDD','Hey there. Many moons ago I wrote a long-winded post about the dangers of aggressively pursuing cosmetic interventions to relieve BDD symptoms. I shared my own history of surgeries gone wrong and how my face doesn\'t look so hot now compared to where I started. I experienced a traumatic rhinoplasty infection and recovery, lost part of my identity, and wasn\'t sure how to rebuild my self-esteem in areas outside of my appearance.\n\nIt shouldn\'t surprise anyone to hear this, but life moves on. Since that post a lot has happened, some things within my control and many things not. My father left this world after a long battle with mantle cell lymphoma. My husband and I bought our first house. My brother and sister-in-law suffered a stillbirth and lost their first child. My friend gave birth to her second child. My job title changed. I moved to a new part of town and began learning how to care for a home. I graduated from grad school.\n\nI attended events, grieved in public and private, met new people, said my fair share of goodbyes, acted strong and other times helplessly, challenged myself, pitied myself, occasionally worked too hard and sometimes too little. During this period I thought about my nose often and how unhappy it made me. I struggled to face the mirror and was also at times consumed by it. The universe, however, was indifferent.\n\nLife has no patience for BDD. The world progresses relentlessly. And what a relief, in a way, to be reminded that my unwell mind is not the only thing to exist. There is other pain and joy to know. Finding myself caught in a reflection is a little more bearable these days. Not because I like the way I look, but because I know it won\'t matter days to months to years from now.\n\nBDD is my companion for life. It\'s not going anywhere, but neither am I. Life moves on, and the force of my illness cannot match the force of forward motion. Onward.\n\n(Putting this out there since I did this last time--feel free to message me for support and I will do my best to respond to you. I\'m still trying to live fully and authentically with this illness, and sometimes that means taking a break from this sub.)',7,0,0,0,11.1,'2022-08-12 16:28:09');
